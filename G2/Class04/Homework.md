## Task 3: Reverse the Case

* Given a string, create a method to reverse the case. All lower-cased letters should be upper-cased, and vice versa.

### Examples:
```C#
ReverseCase("Happy Birthday") âžž "hAPPY bIRTHDAY"

ReverseCase("MANY THANKS") âžž "many thanks"

ReverseCase("sPoNtAnEoUs") âžž "SpOnTaNeOuS"
```

## Task 4: Basic E-Mail Validation

* Create a method that accepts a string, checks if it's a valid email address and returns either true or false, depending on the evaluation.

    * The string must contain an `@` character.
    * The string must contain a `.` character.
    * The `@` must have at least one character in front of it.
        * ex. `"e@mail.com"` is valid, while `"@email.com"` is invalid.
    * The `.` and the `@` must be in the appropriate places.
        * ex. `"hello.email@com"` is invalid while `"john.smith@email.com"` is valid.

* If the string passes these tests, it's considered a valid email address.


### Examples:
```C#
ValidateEmail("@gmail.com") âžž false

ValidateEmail("hello.gmail@com") âžž false

ValidateEmail("gmail") âžž false

ValidateEmail("hello@gmail") âžž false

ValidateEmail("hello@gmail.com") âžž true
```
